//! Decode Attribution Data Collection Gate.
//!
//! This module implements a measurement harness for Core ML decode
//! attribution: structured JSONL receipts capturing materialization,
//! compilation, load, warmup, and prediction timing across matrices
//! (compute-unit × graph family, shape × graph family), with reference
//! numerical conformance against the pure-Rust evaluator.
